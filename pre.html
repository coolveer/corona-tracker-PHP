 <h5 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Know How it Spreads</h5><br>
 <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/sneezingwoman.png" class="text-center"><br>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
  <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
  <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
  <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Take steps to protect yourself</h5><br>
<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Clean your hands often</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/protect-wash-hands.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
  <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
  <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
</ul>
<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Avoid close contact</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/protect-quarantine.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
  <li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
</ul>


<h5 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Take steps to protect others</h5><br>
<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Stay home if you’re sick</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_02_bed.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
</ul>


<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Cover coughs and sneezes</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_06_coverCough.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
  <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
  <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Wear a facemask if you are sick</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_05_mask.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
  <li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="text-center" style="color: blue;">Clean and disinfect</h6><br>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_09_clean.png"><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
  <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
</ul> <br><br><br><br><p>.</p>
